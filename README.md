# EasyEncrypt
EasyEncrypt is a library that makes cryptography easy.
Supports strings, byte arrays and files.
Supports the algorithms Aes, TripleDES, (.net framework only) Des, RC2 and Rijndael. 

# Security
EasyEncrypt uses a random IV.
This means that every output is different and protect you from comparing encrypted outputs.

I suggest to use Aes for the best security.
