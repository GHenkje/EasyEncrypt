# EasyEncrypt
Library that makes encrypting strings, byte arrays and files easy.
Supports Aes, TripleDES, (.net framework only) Des, RC2 and Rijndael. Has good documentation.

# Security
EasyEncrypt uses a random IV.
This means that every output is different and protected from comparing encrypted outputs.

Use Aes for the best security. (2019)
